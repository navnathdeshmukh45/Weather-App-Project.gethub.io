        1. A weather app</b> is a mobile application or website that provides users with information about the current and forecasted weather conditions for a specific location or multiple locations.
        <br> <br>2.  Here is some information typically provided by weather apps:
        <br> <br>
3. Current weather: The app displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, visibility, and atmospheric pressure at the selected location.  
<br>It may also include additional details such as the "feels like" temperature, sunrise and sunset times, and current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). <br><br>

4. Hourly forecast: Weather apps often offer an hourly forecast, which provides weather information for the next several hours.  <br>This includes temperature changes, chances of precipitation, wind speed, and other relevant details. <br><br>

5.Daily forecast: The app provides a forecast for the upcoming days, usually up to a week or more in advance.  <br>It includes the expected high and low temperatures, precipitation chances, and general weather conditions for each day. <br> <br>


6.Extended forecast: Some weather apps offer an extended forecast that goes beyond a week.  <br>This gives users an idea of the weather trends for the upcoming weeks or even months, although the accuracy of such forecasts tends to decrease the further out they go. <br><br>

7.Radar and satellite maps: Many weather apps include radar and satellite maps, allowing users to view the current and approaching weather patterns. <br> These maps show rain, snow, or other precipitation, as well as cloud cover and storm systems. <br><br>

8. Severe weather alerts: Weather apps often send notifications for severe weather alerts issued by meteorological organizations.  <br>These alerts warn users about events like thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, or other potentially dangerous weather conditions. <br><br>

9.Customization and personalization: Weather apps usually allow users to customize the information they want to see, such as temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit), wind speed units, and preferred language. <br> Some apps may also offer additional features like pollen forecasts, UV index information, air quality index, or integration with other services or devices. <br><br>

10.Location-based forecasts: Weather apps can provide forecasts for multiple locations. Users can either manually enter a location or allow the app to access their device's GPS to provide weather information for their current location automatically. <br><br>
